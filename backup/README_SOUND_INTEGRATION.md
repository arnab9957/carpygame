# Sound Integration for Car Racing Game

This guide explains how to add engine sounds that vary with speed to your car racing game.

## Sound Files

The following sound files have been created in the `sounds` directory:

- `engine_idle.wav` - Sound of the engine at idle/low speed
- `engine_low.wav` - Sound of the engine at low speed
- `engine_medium.wav` - Sound of the engine at medium speed
- `engine_high.wav` - Sound of the engine at high speed
- `collision.wav` - Sound for collisions
- `powerup.wav` - Sound for collecting power-ups
- `coin.wav` - Sound for collecting coins

## Sound Engine Module

A sound engine module (`sound_engine.py`) has been created to handle sound playback. This module provides the following functionality:

- Loading and playing engine sounds at different speeds
- Smoothly transitioning between sound levels as speed changes
- Adding special effects for boost activation
- Playing sound effects for game events (collisions, power-ups, coins)

## Integration Steps

To integrate the sound engine into your car racing game, follow these steps:

1. Add the following import at the top of your game file:
   ```python
   import sound_engine
   ```

2. Initialize the sound engine at the beginning of your game:
   ```python
   # Initialize sound engine
   sound_engine.initialize()
   ```

3. Update engine sounds in your game's update method:
   ```python
   # Update engine sounds based on speed
   sound_engine.update_engine_sound(self.speed, self.player_car.is_boosting)
   ```

4. Add sound effects for collisions:
   ```python
   # Play collision sound
   sound_engine.play_collision()
   ```

5. Add sound effects for power-ups:
   ```python
   # Play powerup sound
   sound_engine.play_powerup()
   ```

6. Add sound effects for coins:
   ```python
   # Play coin sound
   sound_engine.play_coin()
   ```

7. Clean up sounds when exiting:
   ```python
   # Stop all sounds
   sound_engine.cleanup()
   ```

## Manual Integration Example

Here's an example of how to manually integrate the sound engine into your game:

```python
# In your game's initialization code
import sound_engine
sound_engine.initialize()

# In your game's update method
def update(self):
    # Update game state
    ...
    
    # Update engine sounds based on speed
    sound_engine.update_engine_sound(self.speed, self.player_car.is_boosting)
    
    # Rest of your update code
    ...

# For collision events
def handle_collision(self):
    # Collision handling code
    ...
    
    # Play collision sound
    sound_engine.play_collision()
    
    # Rest of your collision handling code
    ...

# For power-up collection
def collect_powerup(self):
    # Power-up collection code
    ...
    
    # Play powerup sound
    sound_engine.play_powerup()
    
    # Rest of your power-up collection code
    ...

# For coin collection
def collect_coin(self):
    # Coin collection code
    ...
    
    # Play coin sound
    sound_engine.play_coin()
    
    # Rest of your coin collection code
    ...

# In your game's cleanup/exit code
def cleanup(self):
    # Cleanup code
    ...
    
    # Stop all sounds
    sound_engine.cleanup()
    
    # Rest of your cleanup code
    ...
```

## Customizing Sounds

To use your own sound files, simply replace the files in the `sounds` directory with your own WAV files. Make sure to keep the same filenames.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with sound playback:

1. Make sure pygame is installed: `pip install pygame`
2. Check that the sound files exist in the `sounds` directory
3. Verify that your system has audio capabilities
4. If running in WSL, note that audio might not work properly

The sound engine includes error handling to gracefully continue even if sound files are missing or audio is unavailable.
