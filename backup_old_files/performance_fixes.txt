Performance Optimization Recommendations:

1. Reduce particle effects:
   - Lower particle count in explosions and effects
   - Decrease spawn frequency of visual effects
   - Add distance-based culling for particles

2. Optimize rendering:
   - Cache background gradients instead of redrawing every frame
   - Reduce number of transparency (alpha) operations
   - Implement object pooling for common game elements

3. Limit game objects:
   - Reduce maximum number of obstacles, cars, and coins
   - Increase minimum spawn intervals
   - Add earlier cleanup of off-screen objects

4. Optimize collision detection:
   - Use spatial partitioning or simpler collision shapes
   - Skip collision checks for distant objects

5. Reduce visual complexity:
   - Lower resolution of effects
   - Simplify car and object models
   - Reduce or disable some visual effects during high activity

6. Frame rate management:
   - Cap the frame rate to a stable value (30 FPS)
   - Implement frame skipping when needed
   - Decouple physics updates from rendering
