## How to Fix Fullscreen Mode in Car Racing Game

After analyzing your code, I've identified the issues with the fullscreen mode and created fixes. Here's how to implement them:

### 1. Fix the SettingsMenu class

The `SettingsMenu` class already exists in your code, but there are issues with the `apply_setting` method. Make sure:

- The `SettingsMenu.__init__` method includes `self.windowed_size = (screen_width, screen_height)` to store the original window size
- Replace the `apply_setting` method with the one from `fullscreen_fix.py`

### 2. Fix the Game.show_settings_menu method

Replace or implement the `show_settings_menu` method in your Game class with the one from `show_settings_menu_fix.py`. This method properly handles screen updates when toggling fullscreen mode.

### 3. Make sure global variables are updated

When changing screen modes, these global variables need to be updated:
- SCREEN_WIDTH
- SCREEN_HEIGHT
- SCALE_X
- SCALE_Y
- LANE_WIDTH
- LANE_POSITIONS

### 4. Fix the PauseMenu class

If you have a PauseMenu class with an `apply_setting` method, make sure it's removed or updated to match the SettingsMenu implementation.

### 5. Test the implementation

After making these changes, test the fullscreen toggle by:
1. Running the game
2. Opening the settings menu
3. Toggling fullscreen mode on and off
4. Verifying that the game scales properly in both modes

If you encounter any specific errors during implementation, please provide the error messages for further assistance.
