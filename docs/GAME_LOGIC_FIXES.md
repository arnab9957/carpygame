# Game Logic Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Speed Increment Logic
**Problem**: Speed increment was being affected by power-ups, causing inconsistent base speed progression.
**Fix**: 
- Base speed increment (`self.speed += SPEED_INCREMENT`) is now independent of power-ups
- Power-ups only affect object movement speed, not the base speed progression
- This ensures consistent speed progression regardless of active power-ups

### 2. Boost Effect Application
**Problem**: Boost multiplier was being applied twice in some cases, causing incorrect speed calculations.
**Fix**:
- Removed duplicate boost application in speed factor calculation
- Boost now only affects:
  - Visual speed display (speedometer shows boosted speed)
  - Distance traveled calculation (more distance covered when boosting)
  - Object movement is handled separately through slow-mo factor only

### 3. Magnet Collection Logic
**Problem**: Magnet attraction was weak and inconsistent.
**Fix**:
- Improved magnet attraction algorithm with distance-based speed
- Stronger pull when coins are closer: `magnet_speed = min(distance * 0.1, 8)`
- Maximum magnet speed increased from 5 to 8 pixels per frame
- More responsive coin collection

### 4. Slow-Mo Effect Consistency
**Problem**: Slow-mo factor was inconsistently applied across different game objects.
**Fix**:
- Consistent `slow_mo_factor` application to all moving objects:
  - Obstacles: `obstacle.move(self.speed * slow_mo_factor)`
  - AI Cars: `car.move(self.speed * slow_mo_factor * speed_modifier)`
  - Power-ups: `powerup.move(self.speed * slow_mo_factor)`
  - Coins: `coin.move(self.speed * slow_mo_factor)`

### 5. Speed Display Logic
**Problem**: Speed display didn't properly reflect boost effects.
**Fix**:
- Separated base speed calculation from boost display
- Speed display now correctly shows boosted speed when boost is active
- Formula: `base_speed * BOOST_MULTIPLIER` for display only

### 6. Distance Calculation
**Problem**: Distance traveled didn't account for boost effects.
**Fix**:
- Added distance multiplier for boost effects
- When boosting, player covers more distance: `distance * BOOST_MULTIPLIER`
- Maintains game balance while making boost feel more impactful

### 7. Code Cleanup
**Problem**: Duplicate constant definitions and inconsistent variable usage.
**Fix**:
- Removed duplicate `POWERUP_DURATION` definition
- Cleaned up power-up constant definitions
- Consistent variable naming throughout

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Power-up Behavior**: All power-ups now work as intended with proper duration and effects
2. **Better Game Feel**: Boost feels more impactful, magnet is more responsive, slow-mo is consistent
3. **Accurate Speed Display**: Speedometer correctly reflects current effective speed
4. **Balanced Progression**: Base speed progression is consistent regardless of power-ups
5. **Improved Performance**: Cleaner code with fewer redundant calculations

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test boost power-up to ensure speed display increases correctly
2. Verify magnet attracts coins more effectively, especially at different distances
3. Check that slow-mo affects all objects consistently
4. Confirm speed progression remains steady during different power-up combinations
5. Validate distance calculations are accurate with and without boost

## Technical Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No changes to save file formats or game data structures
- Performance impact is minimal or positive due to code cleanup
- Changes follow the existing code style and patterns
