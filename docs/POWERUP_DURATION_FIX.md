# Power-up Duration Fix

## Problem Identified
Power-ups were persisting until the game ended instead of expiring after their intended duration (5 seconds for most power-ups, 7 seconds for shield).

## Root Cause
**Duplicate Timer Updates**: The `Car.update(dt)` method contained **duplicate power-up timer update sections**, causing timers to be decremented twice per frame. This led to:
1. Power-ups expiring much faster than intended (in some cases)
2. Timer synchronization issues
3. Inconsistent power-up behavior

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Duplicate Timer Updates
**Location**: `Car.update(dt)` method (lines ~1823-1884)

**Before**: Two identical sections updating power-up timers
```python
# First section
if self.has_shield:
    self.shield_timer -= dt
    if self.shield_timer <= 0:
        self.has_shield = False
        self.shield_timer = 0

# ... other power-ups ...

# DUPLICATE SECTION (causing the bug)
if self.has_shield:
    self.shield_timer -= dt
    if self.shield_timer <= 0:
        self.has_shield = False
```

**After**: Single, clean timer update section
```python
# Single section only
if self.has_shield:
    self.shield_timer -= dt
    if self.shield_timer <= 0:
        self.has_shield = False
        self.shield_timer = 0
```

### 2. Added Power-up Reset Method
**Location**: `Car` class

**New Method**: `reset_powerups()`
```python
def reset_powerups(self):
    """Reset all power-up states - useful when restarting game"""
    self.has_shield = False
    self.shield_timer = 0
    self.has_boost = False
    self.boost_timer = 0
    self.is_boosting = False
    self.has_magnet = False
    self.magnet_timer = 0
    self.has_slow_mo = False
    self.slow_mo_timer = 0
    self.boost_energy = 0
```

### 3. Integrated Reset into Game Restart
**Location**: `Game.reset_game()` method

**Added**: Call to reset power-ups when game restarts
```python
# Reset all power-ups to ensure clean state
self.player_car.reset_powerups()
```

### 4. Added Debug Method
**Location**: `Car` class

**New Method**: `get_powerup_status()` for debugging
```python
def get_powerup_status(self):
    """Debug method to check current power-up states"""
    return {
        'shield': {'active': self.has_shield, 'timer': self.shield_timer},
        'boost': {'active': self.has_boost, 'timer': self.boost_timer, 'energy': self.boost_energy},
        'magnet': {'active': self.has_magnet, 'timer': self.magnet_timer},
        'slow_mo': {'active': self.has_slow_mo, 'timer': self.slow_mo_timer}
    }
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Power-up Durations
- **Boost**: 5 seconds (POWERUP_DURATION)
- **Shield**: 7 seconds (SHIELD_DURATION) 
- **Magnet**: 5 seconds (POWERUP_DURATION)
- **Slow-Mo**: 5 seconds (POWERUP_DURATION)

### Power-up Lifecycle
1. **Collection**: Power-up activates immediately when collected
2. **Active Phase**: Effect lasts for specified duration
3. **Expiration**: Power-up automatically deactivates when timer reaches 0
4. **Clean State**: All timers reset to 0, flags set to False

### Game Restart Behavior
- All power-ups are completely reset when starting a new game
- No power-up effects carry over between games
- Fresh start with no active power-ups

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Power-up Duration Testing
- [ ] Collect boost power-up → should last exactly 5 seconds
- [ ] Collect shield power-up → should last exactly 7 seconds  
- [ ] Collect magnet power-up → should last exactly 5 seconds
- [ ] Collect slow-mo power-up → should last exactly 5 seconds

### ✅ Power-up Expiration Testing
- [ ] Verify boost effect stops after 5 seconds (speed returns to normal)
- [ ] Verify shield effect stops after 7 seconds (no crash protection)
- [ ] Verify magnet effect stops after 5 seconds (coins no longer attracted)
- [ ] Verify slow-mo effect stops after 5 seconds (normal game speed)

### ✅ Game Restart Testing
- [ ] Activate power-ups, then restart game → no power-ups should be active
- [ ] Verify clean state: all timers at 0, all flags False
- [ ] Multiple restarts should behave consistently

### ✅ Multiple Power-up Testing
- [ ] Collect multiple power-ups → each should have independent timers
- [ ] Power-ups should expire independently
- [ ] No interference between different power-up timers

## Technical Notes

- **Performance Impact**: Positive - removed redundant timer calculations
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - added one debug method and one reset method
- **Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible, no save file changes
- **Code Quality**: Improved - eliminated duplicate code, added proper state management

## Debugging

If power-up issues persist, use the debug method:
```python
# In game loop or debug console
status = self.player_car.get_powerup_status()
print(status)
```

This will show current state of all power-ups and their remaining timers.
